## Getting Started

### Choose Your Path

You can start with either Python or JavaScript, or work through both:

1. **Python Path**: Start with `python/README.md` for a beginner-friendly introduction
2. **JavaScript Path**: Start with `javascript/README.md` for web-focused learning
3. **Both Paths**: Complete both for comprehensive programming foundation

### Recommended Learning Order

1. **Start with Python** (easier for beginners)

   - Follow the Python README
   - Complete all basics exercises
   - Build the todo app project

2. **Then learn JavaScript** (useful for web development)
   - Follow the JavaScript README
   - Complete all basics exercises
   - Build the web server project

## What You'll Learn

### Programming Fundamentals

- **Variables and Data Types**: Storing and manipulating information
- **Control Flow**: Making decisions and repeating actions
- **Functions**: Organizing code into reusable blocks
- **Error Handling**: Dealing with unexpected situations
- **File Operations**: Reading and writing data

### Problem-Solving Skills

- Breaking down complex problems into smaller parts
- Using algorithms and data structures
- Debugging and troubleshooting code
- Testing and validating solutions

### Development Practices

- Writing clean, readable code
- Using version control (Git basics)
- Following coding conventions
- Documenting your code

## Tools You'll Use

### Python Environment

- **Python 3.x**: Programming language
- **pip**: Package manager
- **IDLE or VS Code**: Code editor
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive coding (optional)

### JavaScript Environment

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime
- **npm**: Package manager
- **VS Code**: Code editor
- **Browser Developer Tools**: For web development

## Success Criteria

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- Write simple programs in both Python and JavaScript
- Understand basic programming concepts and syntax
- Solve programming problems independently
- Set up and use development environments
- Feel confident moving to more advanced topics

## Time Commitment

- **Python Basics**: 4-6 hours
- **JavaScript Basics**: 4-6 hours
- **Projects**: 2-4 hours each
- **Total**: 10-20 hours

## Next Steps
