## Getting Started

### Choose Your Path

You can start with any of the three paths, or work through all of them:

1. **Python Path**: Start with `python/README.md` for a beginner-friendly introduction
2. **JavaScript Path**: Start with `javascript/README.md` for web-focused learning
3. **Bash Path**: Start with `bash/README.md` for command-line mastery
4. **All Paths**: Complete all three for comprehensive programming foundation

### Recommended Learning Order

1. **Start with Bash** (essential for DevOps)

   - Follow the Bash README
   - Learn navigation and file operations
   - Master system and text processing commands
   - Practice network and connectivity commands

2. **Then learn Python** (easier for beginners)

   - Follow the Python README
   - Complete all basics exercises
   - Build the todo app project

3. **Finally learn JavaScript** (useful for web development)
   - Follow the JavaScript README
   - Complete all basics exercises
   - Build the web server project

## What You'll Learn
